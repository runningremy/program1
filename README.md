# program1

Program 1 simply defines a variable. We'll call the variable a.

Programs 2 and 3... will build upon program 1. For instance, program 2 will assign a value to our variable.

I've chosen a handful of programming languages to build this program.. C, ASM, Python, Rust, C++, Haskell, FORTRAN, SQL.
